# Euchred - Stat Tracker

Card nights always end with the same argument: who’s been euchred more. Euchred ends the debate. Tap to log every loss, settle the score instantly, and retire the pencil-and-paper guesswork.

Euchred is a free and open source iOS app that tracks the number of times each player gets euchred. No ads, no tracking, no payments.
